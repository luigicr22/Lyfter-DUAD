              Blogging is far from dead. As the last two years of
              X-formerly-Twitter drama has shown, allowing a social media
              platform to control your access to your audience has big risks. If
              you want a platform where you can share your thoughts properly and
              keep control of things, it's impossible to beat a blog. Plus, you
              can always share your blog posts on social media, through a
              newsletter, and anywhere else. The whole point of a blog is that
              it's your content to do with as you will.

              Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources and
              recommendations to customers, the best way to do it is often to
              add a blog to your website. Best of all, your blog content gets
              indexed by Google—unlike almost all social media posts—so you can
              drive potential customers to your business through content
              marketing (and without having to pay for ads). Look at the blog
              you're reading right now: Zapier blog posts get millions of views
              per month and are one of the most valuable ways of getting new
              customers at Zapier.
